<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, everyone! My name is Ilan Kalantarov, and I'm excited to introduce myself as
   a Junior Developer based in Israel. I am currently in my third year of studying 
   Computer Sciences, where I've been enriching my skills and passion for programming.
   So far, I have learned Java OOP, C, and data structures, but I also have a good grasp 
   of web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js.</p>

<p>Throughout my journey, I've gained invaluable experience working in different roles. 
   These days Iâ€™m part of the NOC team in the Ministry of Defense, where I've honed my technical
   troubleshooting abilities and enhanced my teamwork skills. Additionally, I've taken on freelance
   projects, specializing in website development using WordPress and WooCommerce. 
   These experiences have given me the chance to tackle real-world challenges and showcase
   my problem-solving capabilities.</p>

<p>These days, I'm looking for a new opportunity as a developer, where I can leverage my skills
   and knowledge to contribute to projects and grow professionally. I'm ready to take on new 
   challenges, collaborate with a dynamic team, and continue my learning journey in the world 
   of software development. To sum up, I would be more than happy for any relevant roles as a 
   Junior Developer.
   <br/>
   <br/>I greatly appreciate you taking the time to read my letter.
